Chrome Extension for Highlighting Entities on a webpage. Yellow: Person, Blue: Location, Green: Organization, Brown: Miscellaneous

When packaging the extension please exclude the test_bert.py file. It is a file to establish a REST API that the extension connects to.
To run the extension, run the test_bert.py file on a server and if needed change the connection url in the payload.js file to connect to the server appropriately.
